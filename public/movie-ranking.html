 <h1>The Best Movies According To OGI </h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

<h3>The Enemy</h3>
<p>The movie was like semi-mindfuck wibe. Which kinda questions the reality.</p>
<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p>Has the element of complete mindfuck. To understand Donnie Darko you got to watch it couple of times tho.</p>
<h3>Edge Of Tomorrow</h3>
Guess I like the mind-fuck element in the movies. The movie was not that hard to understand but the action aspect makes you watch it couple of times.
